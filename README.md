Set of Klipper Config Files for my Anycubic i3 Mega

This is just a dumping ground for the configs I have for my Anycubic i3 Mega printer. It has TMC2209 drivers, the new MK4 carridge (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3537449) and also a Raspberry Pi 2 in the base + extra dedicated mosfets for heating and the bed + hotend. Also an LED strip around the outside edge which allow for the camera to show a good livestream.
